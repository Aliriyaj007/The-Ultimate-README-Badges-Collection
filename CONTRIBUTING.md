# Contributing to The Ultimate README Badges Collection

First off, **thank you** for considering contributing! 🥳 

This repository relies on community contributions to stay the largest and most up-to-date source of README badges. We want to make contributing as easy as possible.

## ⚡ Quick Start: Add a Badge in 2 Minutes

1.  **Find the right category** in the `/Categories/` folder.
2.  **Copy the format** of existing badges in that file.
3.  **Add your badge** to the table.
4.  **Open a Pull Request**.

That's it! We usually merge valid PRs within 24-48 hours.

## 🛑 Contribution Rules

To ensure high quality, please follow these simple rules:

### Do ✅
*   **Use reliable providers:** Prefer [Shields.io](https://shields.io/), official service badges, or well-maintained generators.
*   **Check visual consistency:** If adding to a list of "Classic" badges, don't add a "For-the-badge" style unless there is a specific section for it.
*   **Verify the link:** Ensure the badge renders and the link destination works.
*   **Alphabetical Order:** Try to keep lists alphabetized if possible, it helps everyone find things.

### Don't ❌
*   **No broken images:** If the badge doesn't load, we can't merge it.
*   **No duplicates:** Check if the badge already exists in the file (or another category).
*   **No "Novelty" without utility:** Purely decorative formatting quirks that aren't reusable badges should go in `10-custom-other.md`.
