# 🛠️ Badge Utilities (Roadmap)

We are planning to build tools to make badge management even easier.

## 🚧 Coming Soon

*   **Badge Validatior:** A script to check all links in your README to ensure no badges are broken/404.
*   **Badge Generator CLI:** A command line tool to generate a "Perfect Badge Block" for your repo based on your `package.json` or project structure.
*   **Auto-Updater:** A GitHub Action to automatically update your copyright year or static version badges.

## 🤝 Want to contribute?
If you have an idea for a utility script, please open a PR! We accept:
*   Python scripts (`.py`)
*   Node.js scripts (`.js`)
*   Bash scripts (`.sh`)

Please place them in this directory with their own `README.md` if complex.
